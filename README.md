Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This program is a visualization of sorting algorithms using the Pygame library. It allows you to visualize the sorting process of two algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. The program generates a list of random values and animates the sorting process step by step.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library

Installation and Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the Pygame library by running the command pip install pygame.
Download the source code files and save them in a directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
Run the program by executing the command python sorting_visualization.py.
The sorting visualization window will open, displaying a list of blocks representing the values to be sorted.

Interact with the visualization using the following keys:
R: Reset the list with new random values.
SPACE: Start/stop the sorting process.
A: Set the sorting order to ascending.
D: Set the sorting order to descending.
I: Switch to Insertion Sort algorithm.
B: Switch to Bubble Sort algorithm.
Close the window to exit the program.

Customization
You can modify the parameters n, min_val, and max_val in the main function to change the size and range of the initial random list.
Additional sorting algorithms can be implemented by defining a new function and integrating it into the main program flow.
